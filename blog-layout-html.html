        <p>
          Puri is famous as the land of Lord Jagannatha, where the annual
          Rathayatra festival draws millions of devotees from all over the
          world. The state of Odisha is also famous as Utkala and Udradesh. It
          is situated between the Rushikulya and the Mahanadi rivers.
        </p>

        <h2>Glories of Jagannath Puri</h2>
        <h3>Aisvarya-dhama</h3>
        <p>
          Aisvarya means “opulence.” The worship of Lord Jagannatha is carried
          out in great opulence, and the name, form, pastimes and abode of Lord
          evoke feelings of awe and reverence in the worshiper. The Lord resides
          in Sri Mandir with His consort Laksmi Devi.
        </p>

        <h3>Audarya-dhama</h3>
        <p>
          Audarya means “magnanimity.” Lord Jagannatha’s dealings are
          characterized by generosity, kindness and mercy. Therefore He is
          famous as Patita-pavana, “the savior of the fallen.”
        </p>

        <h3>Madhurya-dhama</h3>
        <p>
          Madhurya means “sweetness.” Although He is the Supreme Personality of
          Godhead, Lord Jagannatha deals with His devotees in an intimate way.
          Several devotees over the centuries bear testimony to this fact. Also
          Lord Caitanya during His stay in Puri displayed the sweet mode of
          intense love which the Vrajavasis felt in separation from Krishna.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus Jagannatha Puri has all three features simultaneously present:
          the opulence of Laksmi Devi in Dvaraka; the merciful magnanimity of
          Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu; and the unlimited sweetness of the mood of
          the vrajagopis.
        </p>
